# spotify_extra

An app that provides extra functionality for spotify users.

## Overview

Gives you access to some features of the spotify api that aren't available in the spotify app.

Features that I have planned for this app include:

- analyze a song (get audio features for it)
- analyze a playlist (get all audio features and average them)

Future features of this app may include:

- signing in to your spotify account (Enables other features)
- get your top genres/artists/tracks/etc...
  - different time frames (past week/month/year)
- manage account:
  - like songs
  - manage friends list
  - create/modify/delete playlists
  - create playlist groups:
    - you can add a song to a playlist group and it will add it to all individual playlists inside
- list of top global songs/artists/etc... by week/month/etc...
  - might not be possible (or extremely difficult/taxing)
- show streaming history
- shazam button to find a song by listening to your microphone
  - you could then like it or add to a playlist
- migrate shazam and spotify api code into packages and publish them on pub.dev
  - the packages would simply make interfacing with the apis easier

**Many of these features come from 'Spotistats(Stats.fm)' / 'Stats.fm for Spotify', huge shoutout to them for the inspiration for this project**
